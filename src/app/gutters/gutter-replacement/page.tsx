          {
            question: 'When is gutter replacement better than repair?',
            answer:
              'Gutter replacement is recommended when gutters are over 20 years old, have extensive rust or corrosion, multiple sections are pulling away from the house, you have frequent leaks despite repairs, or repair costs approach 50% of replacement cost. New gutters provide decades of worry-free protection and often save money compared to ongoing repairs.',
          },
          {
            question: 'What are the benefits of seamless gutters?',
            answer:
              'Seamless gutters are fabricated on-site to exact measurements with no joints or seams except at corners and downspouts. This eliminates most leak points, provides superior water flow, requires less maintenance, and offers a cleaner appearance. Seamless gutters last longer and perform better than sectional gutters.',
          },
          {
            question: 'How long does gutter replacement take?',
            answer:
              'Most residential gutter replacement projects are completed in 1-2 days depending on home size and complexity. We work efficiently to minimize disruption while ensuring quality installation. Weather conditions may affect timing, but we always complete projects as quickly as possible.',
          },
          {
            question: 'What warranty do you provide on gutter replacement?',
            answer:
              'We provide comprehensive warranties on both materials and labor. Gutter materials typically come with 20-30 year manufacturer warranties, while our installation labor is warranted for 5-10 years depending on the project. We stand behind our work and use only premium materials.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Do you handle permits and inspections?',
            answer:
              'Most gutter replacement projects do not require permits, but we handle all necessary permits and inspections when required. We ensure all work meets local building codes and HOA requirements. Our licensed contractors are familiar with all local regulations.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Can you match gutters to my home\'s style?',
            answer:
              'Absolutely. We offer multiple gutter profiles (K-style, half-round), various sizes, and over 20 color options. Our experts help you select gutters that complement your home\'s architecture while providing optimal performance. Custom colors are available for special projects.',
          },

            question: 'What happens to my old gutters?',
